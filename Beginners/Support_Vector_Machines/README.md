Support vector machines (SVMs) are a set of supervised learning methods used for classification, regression and outliers detection.

The advantages of support vector machines are:

Effective in high dimensional spaces.

Still effective in cases where number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples.

Uses a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient.

Versatile: different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function. Common kernels are provided, but it is also possible to specify custom kernels.

For the implementation, I have used the famous Iris flower data set.
The Iris flower data set or Fisher's Iris data set is a multivariate data set introduced by Sir Ronald Fisher in the 1936 as an example of discriminant analysis.
The data set consists of 50 samples from each of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor), so 150 total samples. Four features were measured from each sample: the length and the width of the sepals and petals, in centimeters.
The iris dataset contains measurements for 150 iris flowers from three different species.

The three classes in the Iris dataset:

Iris-setosa (n=50)

Iris-versicolor (n=50)

Iris-virginica (n=50)

The four features of the Iris dataset:

sepal length in cm

sepal width in cm

petal length in cm

petal width in cm
